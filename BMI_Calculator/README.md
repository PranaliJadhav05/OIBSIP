# BMI Calculator (Python)

This project is a beginner-friendly Python program that helps users
calculate their Body Mass Index (BMI) using weight and height.

The program takes height in centimeters and weight in kilograms,
then converts the height into meters before calculating BMI.

Based on the BMI value, it also shows the health category such as
Normal, Underweight, or Overweight.

## Why I made this project
I created this project to practice Python basics like:
- user input
- functions
- conditional statements
- error handling

## How to run
1. Make sure Python is installed
2. Run the file using:
   python bmi_calculator.py
